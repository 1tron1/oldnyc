- Using bulk loader is hard!
    Designed for very large amounts of data
    Doesn't work well with local instances -- took 2 hours to upload 5 MB.

    How to load binary data?

    Documentation doesn't mention:
    * importance of CSV header row
    * how to load binary data?

- appcfg.py only told me about the 3000 file limit after hitting 3000!

- it would be so much nicer to run locally w/ the remote db.
