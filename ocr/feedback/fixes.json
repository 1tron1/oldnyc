It was destroyed by fire four times. First on May 26, 1828, when it was rebuilt and reopened in 90 days. It was destroyed again September 22, 1836; for the third time, February 8, 1838; and last on April 25, 1845. It retained the name Bowery until 1879, when it was re-christened the Thalia. Its final and last fire occured on June 15, 1929 and the remains disfigured the area for several years. Today (1937) this old landmark is completely gone, a low business structure occupying the site. The Bull's Head, a tavern used for the sale of cattle stood on this site from prior to 1763\nto 1826, when it was taken down.\nFebruary 1924.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",

It is particularly interesting as showing graphically how the metropolis is being honeycombed for its underground transportation system. In order not to interfere with the ordinary use of the streets during the three years necessary to complete the work, the tunneling method is used rather than open excavation work. For a long period after the earth has been dug up and before the steel & concrete work is completed, the surface of the street is merely boards propped up by wooden beams.

Seven persons were killed & scores seriously injured. There are forty-five miles of subway under construction in New York, one line being under the most important & congested thoroughfare, Broadway.

The idea of an industrial exposition housed in a building of glass and iron originated in London with the Crystal Palace of 1851, in Hyde Park. The New York building, however, was smaller than its London predecessor, and entirely different in appearance. It was originally planned to build the Crystal Palace in Madison Square Park, but the protests of residents in that fashionable neighborhood compelled the abandonment of the scheme. The land in back of the Croton Reservoir, now Bryant Park, but then known as Reservoir Square, was leased from the City for a nominal rental of one dollar a year. Construction work began in 1852, and the building, housing the first World's Fair to be held in the United States, was formally opened on July 14, 1853, by President Franklin Pierce. The building, however, was not a financial success, as its London predecessor had been. The city took possession in May of 1858, and on October 5 of that year, while the City Fathers were debating the question of the removal of the building, and while the annual exposition of the American Institute was in progress, fire broke out, and the building was completely destroyed. The land was then converted by the city into the present Bryant Park.\nThis is a photograph made for the sake of preservation from the original, a rare and badly faded photograph, whose plate has 1ong ago been lost.

He was the eldest son of Johannes Van Wyck whose father, an earlier Cornelius Van Wyck, was one of the patentees of Mid-Wout, having emigrated there from Holland in 1660.\nIn 1705, 125 acres of land south and east of the present house at West Drive and Alston Pl., was purchased from Richard and Sarah Cornell by Johannes Van Wyck. His brother Theodorus had already acquired land on King's Point. Johannes had three sons and four daughters and became a Justice of the Provincial Courts.\nWhen Justice Johannes died in 1734, the property was inherited by his eldest son Cornelius who had married Mary Hicks, daughter of Judge Isaac Hicks. Cornelius and Mary prospered, added to the original farm, and until Cornelius' death in 1759, lived in the house they had built twenty-four years earlier.\nCornelius left three sons - Stephan, Cornelius II, and Gilbert. Stephan, the eldest, inherited the house and flourishing farm. Cornelius II had the misfortune of being captured by the British in a surprise raid on Flushing and was confined aboard one of the notorious prison ships anchored in the Wallabout (Bay). He died soon after his release from the effects of a year's confinement under horrible conditions. Stephan fell heir to the appointment as\ndelegate to the Continental Congress, to which office his deceased brother Cornelius had been elected in June, 1776.\nGilbert Van Wyck, the youngest of the three brothers, was a Tory and served as a justice of the peace for King George III until the end of the war when he joined the Tory exodus to Nova Scotia. His cousins Captain Thomas Hicks and Captain Thomas Van Wyck, who had remained loyal to the crown, went with him.\nHowever, Major Cornelius Van Wyck, Gilbert's son, fought with the Continental army for the duration of the war since he did not share his father's political views.\nConsequently, in 1789, Major Cornelius Van Wyck inherited the house and land jointly with his cousin Stephan, son of the Cornelius-of-the-prison-ship. Stephan was not interested in farming and sold his interest to Major Cornelius who thus became the last Van Wyck owner of the house his grandfather built in 1735. The Major held the property for another thirty years and in 1819 sold it to Wynant Van Zandt, one of the early merchants and an alderman of old New York City.\nVan Zandt, who had previously purchased the adjoining 12O acres to the north now commonly known as \"The Point\" area of Douglas Manor, began in 1819 the construction of a large manor house in \"The Point\" section. It is assumed that his family occupied the Van Wyck house during the construction of the new manor house. In fact, among several interesting items found in the chimney place of the old house during some restoration work were two copy books signed by Charlotte Van Zandt, presumably one of Van Zandt's four daughters. In addition they had eleven sons so could well use the large new manor house.\nIn 1835 George Douglas purchased the Manor house and the 12O acres on the point. After his death in 1862 his son William inherited the property. During the tenure of the Douglas family the old Van Wyck house was used as a guest house or was rented to friends. One such was Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau, who founded the famous tuberculosis sanitarium at Saranac Lake, New York. Trudeau married in 1871 Charlotte Beare whose father was rector of Zion Episcopal Church in Douglaston for 45 years, from 1587 to 1888. The Beare family were close friends of the Douglas' and when Trudeau and Charlotte Beare were married, William Douglas gave the wedding reception in the Manor House. After a honeymoon of several months in Europe, the couple rented the old Van Wyck house and lived there for the first year of their married life.\nIn 1906 the entire property, including the Manor House and the old Van Wyck house, was sold to the Douglas Manor Company. The Manor House became an inn and the old Van Wyck house became the first home of the Douglaston Club. In 1921 the Douglaston Club took possession of the Manor House and it is still being used as the community social and recreational center. The old Van Wyck house was bought by Mr. and Wrs. E.M. Wicht who did away with some structures which had been added when the house was used as a club and restored the old house to its original foundation. In 1933 the house was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. L. Keville Larson who are still in residence.\n\nJune 1965\nC. Manley De Bevoise\n51-05 Browvale Lane\nLittle Neck, N.Y.\n",

In the background may be seen the tower of the new Consolidated Gas and New York Edison Building, recently completed on 14th Street on the site of the old Tammany Hall and the Academy of Music. The Society of St. Tammany, or Columbian Order, was founded in Philadelphia and spread through New England, before a New York City chapter was established in 1789. It was originally a benevolent organization, and first identified itself with politics in the presidential campaign of 1800, when, under the leadership of Vice Presidential candidate Aaron Burr, it supported the Jefferson-Burr ticket. The first Tammany Hall, built in 1801, stood on Frankfort and Nassau Streets. On July 4, 1868, the second Hall on 14th Street was opened with the Democratic National Convention of that year.

It had snowed steadily for twenty-four hours on March 12, and the snow continued to fall on the 13th, while the temperature dropped to four degrees below zero and the wind rose to a velocity of eighty-four miles an hour. It was estimated that the storm took a toll of 400 lives and $20,000,000 in property damage. The complex life of the city was at a complete standstill for two days. Thawing temperatures on March 14 aided in the slow task of digging out, which continued for several days. There were countless freak consequences of the storm, such as the sending of messages from Boston to New York by way of London, because all land telegraph service was disrupted, but the submarine cables were undisturbed. The average fall of snow was three feet four inches, but the high winds piled the drifts up to second-story window levels in msny places. Three scenes from the blizzard are sent you.\n\nNew York, N.Y. - This photograph was taken after the storm had subsided and shows New Street, looking toward Wall Street.\nN-3Y938 (S)\n\n",
