General approach:
- Write a script to crop an image based on tesseract boxes
  -> Assess accuracy on 10 images
- Write a script to generate histograms of box widths
- Write a script to split boxes & add artificial white lines
- Compare accuracy of boxes on:
  - Cropped + binarized images (using Otsu or local adaptive)
  - Cropped + split images
