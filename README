To get going:

git clone git://github.com/danvk/sfhistory.git
gunzip -c records.pickle.gz > records.pickle
tar -xzf geocache.tgz
echo "records.pickle\ngeocache\n*.pyc\nimages" >> .git/info/exclude

These files could be checked in directly, but that seemed wasteful.

Python can read the pickle.gz file directly, but this winds up being an order
of magnitude slower than reading the uncompressed version.
