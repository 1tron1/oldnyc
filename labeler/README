The goal here is to build an image geocoding game, publicize it and use
people's good will to geocode all the images in the SFPL's collection.

To get going:
- Install the App Engine SDK
- Run "dev_appserver.py ." from this dir

To clear the db:
- Hit the "SDK Console" button in the App Engine Launcher
- Run this:
import db

rs = db.ImageRecord.all()
for r in rs: r.delete()
