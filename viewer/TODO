To match Raven's mocks:
x Make the image viewer cover the entire page with 50% opacity
x Show a single expanded image "card" centered
- Add jcarousel.min.js
- Build out DOM for all the images (or whatever jcarousel needs)
- Restyle individual slides
- Verify that I'm not doing el('nonexistent-id') anywhere.
