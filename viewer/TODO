To match Raven's mocks:
x Make the image viewer cover the entire page with 50% opacity
x Show a single expanded image "card" centered
- Show multiple images
- Add jcarousel.min.js
- Restyle individual slides

Cleanup:
- Make sure I'm not loading invisible images
- Verify that I'm not doing el('nonexistent-id') anywhere.
- Get rid of all these IDs!
